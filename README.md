The only Discord bot you'll need developed by Pukima#7331.

**More information and a Wiki is in progress.**

## Easy Installation
In a terminal run the following commands:
1. `git clone https://github.com/kayano-bot/kayano.git`
2. cd kayano
3. Outside (or inside) the terminal edit the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
- In the terminal again (also same folder as before) run:
4. `yarn` (if not installed install [node](https://nodejs.org) and then run `npm i -g yarn`)
5. In the terminal again (also same folder as before) run: `node kayano.js`
6. Now you can choose to either
    - Start the bot
    - Start the RPC (your activity) ad
    - Register commands (so that you can actually use the commands)
    - Update the Bot to it's latest version
    - Quit (you can also achieve the same by pressing `ctrl+c`)
